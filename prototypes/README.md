# Prototypes

Proof-of-concept implementations and experimental features.

## Purpose

This directory is for:

- Testing conversion approaches
- Validating component architectures
- Experimenting with different frameworks
- Creating working demos

## Guidelines

- Each prototype should have its own subdirectory
- Include a README explaining the prototype's purpose
- Document learnings and insights
- Keep experiments isolated to avoid conflicts
