# Component Library

Reusable UI components generated from or inspired by Figma mockups.

## Structure

Organize components by category:

```
components/
├── atoms/            # Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, labels)
├── molecules/        # Simple combinations (form fields, cards)
├── organisms/        # Complex components (headers, forms, sidebars)
└── templates/        # Page-level layouts
```

## Development Guidelines

- Each component should have a clear single responsibility
- Match Figma design specifications precisely
- Include props for customization
- Document usage with examples
- Consider accessibility from the start
